# Build a Portfolio Site

This is the second project that belongs to the Front-end Development from Udacity. This is my portfolio website.

- [Responsive Web Design Fundamentals](https://eu.udacity.com/course/responsive-web-design-fundamentals--ud893).
- [Responsive Images](https://eu.udacity.com/course/responsive-images--ud882).
